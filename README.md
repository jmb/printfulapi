## Contributing

I have been trying to follow the project structure guide as laid out by [The Hitchhikers Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/) with [this guide from pretzellogix.net](https://www.pretzellogix.net/2021/12/08/how-to-write-a-python3-sdk-library-module-for-a-json-rest-api/) my initial guide on how to write an API library module.

Please submit pull requests and comments - I'm sure this could be better!
